# This is very basic thread based async adapter, based on ThreadPool!!!
# Use it with cautions!
# Use cases:
# * Short-lived, non-critical tasks (e.g., logging, cache warming, async notifications).
# * Jobs that donâ€™t require retries (e.g., analytics tracking).
# * Single-server applications where persistence is not required.
